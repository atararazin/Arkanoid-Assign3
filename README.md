# Arkanoid-Base

## About:
Surely you know the game Arkanoid? If you answered no, you probably just didn't know that was its name. 
To check out the original game, go
to the following link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arkanoid 

So, in this project, we began with the basics of the game - a moving paddle, blocks that count the amount of hits it receives, etc.
For the full assignment, click https://github.com/yoavg/ioop2016/wiki/Assignment-3. Additionally, I added a UML diagram of the different relations between the classes. Check it out, it's called UML.pdf
